In this directory, you should write the program `scheduler.c` and compile it into the binary `scheduler` (e.g., `gcc -o scheduler scheduler.c -Wall -Werror`). You should do it inside the Ubuntu machine you have setup, as grading will be done so inside the Ubuntu.

After doing so, you can run the tests from this directory by running the
`./run_tests.sh` script. If all goes well, you will see standard output that indicate that all tests are passed.


Passing all tests are not sufficient to obtain all points for this assignment. As an example, any assignment in which hardcodes the expected output to pass the test case will lead to point deductions.
